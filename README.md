# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
I was tasked with the project of modifying the PlanMyTrip App for Jack. He wants to include options for weather descriptions to the data, allow users to be able to input statements to filter data for their preferences to identify travel destinations and hotels, while being able to create a travel route. 

## Results
I was able to retreive the weather data and created a database which I used to import into a travel map and travel itinerary within the map.
The following map shows what users will see when searching vacations. ![WeatherPy_vacation_map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108022219/181589151-f331ace7-1987-47f8-96e2-6efe0c1e7314.png)
The next map shows how the users can plot a route using the app.

## Summary
After coding the data for the app it looks like was taken to a next level as Jack requested. The app will definitely be more user friendly.
